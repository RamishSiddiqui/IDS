# Fake News Detection
<p>In recent years, deceptive content such as fake news and fake reviews have increasingly become a dangerous prospect for online users. Fake reviews have affected consumers and stores alike. Furthermore, the problem of fake news has gained attention in 2016, especially in the aftermath of the last U.S. presidential elections. The dataset is collected from the articles and we try to find which article consists of fake news and which one consists of real news. For this, the dataset collector creates two different .csv files. One file contains the information of articles having fake news and one file for the articles that have fake news. Information such as Article titles, subject, date and their text. Each file contains 21417 rows/articles information.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we use an algorithm known as "Support Vector Machine" to predict whether the news is fake or real. A fake news detection system aims to help users detect and filter out varieties of potentially misleading news. Predicting the likelihood that a particular piece of information is intentionally misleading relies on the analysis of truthful and misleading information previously seen. The scarcity of misleading information, available as a corpus for predictive modeling, is a major obstacle in this area of natural language processing (NLP) and deception detection. We apply the term Document Frequency Reverse Frequency (TF-IDF) for text preprocessing and use sklearn built in methods for the efficirnt work because our main focus is on good prediction instead of model building. </p>
